# Instructions 
To run, install papi: http://icl.utk.edu/papi/software/
Each file should have compilation instructions in it. 

# General 
The papi-code folder contains sample code that papi folks provided to show how
to use the framework. If you get weird errors with the tests folder, it would be
nice to validate that the files in papi-code work.
